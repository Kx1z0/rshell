 A tool that makes the process of searching for and editing rev-shells more easy. You have the option to select the IP you want, and it will automatically edit for you.

If you want to have the script inside the PATH, run the path script, which will move the rshell file to /usr/bin, and then the path file, will auto-delete

New feature added: Now you can choose the port
